 * Responsive multi-pane layouts for different screen sizes.
 *
 * ## When to Use
 *
 * - Tablet and desktop layouts
 * - Foldable device support
 * - Apps that need different layouts based on screen width
 * - Master-detail that becomes side-by-side on large screens
 *
 * ## Pattern Overview

 * screen width. On phones, navigation is typically stack-based. On tablets
 * and desktops, multiple panes can be shown side-by-side.
