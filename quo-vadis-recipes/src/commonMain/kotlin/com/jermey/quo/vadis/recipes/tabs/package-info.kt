/**
 * # Tabbed Navigation Recipes
 *
 * Bottom navigation and tab patterns with state preservation.
 *
 * ## When to Use
 *
 * - Apps with 3-5 primary sections (Home, Search, Profile, etc.)
 * - Bottom navigation bars
 * - Tab layouts at any level of the navigation hierarchy
 *
 * ## Pattern Overview
 *
 * Tabbed navigation allows users to switch between independent sections
 * of an app. Each tab maintains its own navigation state, which is preserved
 * when switching between tabs.
 *
 * ## Available Recipes
 *
 * - [BottomTabsRecipe] - Simple bottom navigation with 3-4 tabs
 * - [TabWithNestedStackRecipe] - Tabs where each tab has its own navigation stack
